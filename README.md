## Background and Overview

Finding a job is hard, but Jobyssey is here to help you stay organized along your odyssey to success. No more messy spreadsheets. Jobyssey keeps track of every detail of your job application from application deadline and job description to networking contacts and preparation notes. On top of that, Jobyseey incorporates the d3-sankey library and generates personalized sankey diagrams to easily visualize the progress of job searching you have accomplished.

Jobyssey is not only an organization tool. It is also a safe place for job seekers to share their interviewing experiences. Under our explore page, users can search and view other job seekersâ€™ experience at different companies. They are able to share about their own thoughts and interview experiences anonymously, too. Jobyssey dedicates to simplify your job search and create a collaborative environment for all job seekers to achieve their success.

Jobyssey is primarily built with the MERN stack, a combination of the following four technologies: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.
